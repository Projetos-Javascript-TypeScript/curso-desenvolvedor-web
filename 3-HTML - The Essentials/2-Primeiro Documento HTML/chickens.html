        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">Fowl</a>, with attributes of
        wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
        is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is
        a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
