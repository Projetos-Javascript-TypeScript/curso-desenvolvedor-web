            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">Fowl</a>, with attributes of
            wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl<sup><a href="somesource.com">[1]</a></sup> that are
            originally
            from
            Southeastern Asia.
            Rooster or cock
            is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
            castrated is
            a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
                hen.[11][12]

        <h2>General biology and habitat </h2>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
            even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]</p>
